    "text": "The Big Ten has money, fans and coverage, but in the past decade they haven’t had depth. Save for Ohio State, Michigan and occasionally Penn State; no other Big Ten team consistently does anything special throughout the fall. The middle and lower tiers of the conference have struggled to stay competitive, often cycling through coaches, rebuilding phases and less than impressive seasons. As a result, the conference’s reputation has leaned heavily on a small handful of elite programs who disguise the true mediocrity of the Big Ten.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\nrecord25 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record25.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2025)\nrecord24 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record24.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2024)\nrecord23 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023)\nrecord22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\nrecord21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nrecord20 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nrecord19 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\nrecord18 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\nrecord17 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\nrecord16 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\nrecord15 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015)\nrecord14 &lt;- read_csv(\"Record14.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2014)\n\n\n\nrecords &lt;- bind_rows(record25, record24, record23, record22, record21, record20, record19, record18, record17, record16, record15, record14) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Conf = gsub(\" (West)\", \"\", Conf, fixed=TRUE),\n    Conf = gsub(\" (East)\", \"\", Conf, fixed=TRUE),\n    TeamSeason = paste(School, Season)\n    )\n\n\n\np4 &lt;- c(\"ACC\", \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big 12\")\n\nbig10 &lt;- c(\"Rutgers\", \"Purdue\", \"Northwestern\", \"Nebraska\", \"Minnesota\", \"Michigan State\",\"Maryland\", \"Indiana\", \"Illinois\")\n\n\n\nlosers &lt;- records |&gt; \n  filter(Conf %in% p4) |&gt; \n  filter(Season != 2025) |&gt; \n  filter(Pct &lt; .5) |&gt; \n  group_by (School, Conf, SRS, SOS) |&gt; \n  tally(sort=TRUE) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  top_n(15, wt=n)\n\nbig10loser &lt;- records |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Big Ten\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season != 2025) |&gt; \n  filter(Pct &lt; .5) |&gt; \n  group_by (School, Conf, SRS, SOS) |&gt; \n  tally(sort=TRUE) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\n\nbad &lt;- records |&gt; filter(SOS &lt; -15)\nloserseasons &lt;- records |&gt; filter(School %in% losers$School) |&gt; filter(Pct &lt; .5)\ngood &lt;- records |&gt; filter(SRS &gt; 30)\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = records, aes(x = SOS, y = SRS), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=loserseasons, aes(x = SOS, y = SRS), color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_point(data=big10loser, aes(x = SOS, y = SRS), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = records, aes(x = SOS, y = SRS), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  geom_point(data=bad, aes(x = SOS, y = SRS), color=\"red\") +  \n  geom_text_repel(data=bad, aes(x=SOS, y=SRS, label=TeamSeason)) +\n   geom_point(data=good, aes(x = SOS, y = SRS), color=\"green\") + \n     geom_text_repel(data=good, aes(x=SOS, y=SRS, label=TeamSeason)) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Strength of Schedule\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"Big Ten football remains average\", \n    subtitle=\"The grey dots show every FBS season since 2014.

The Big Ten accounts for nine of those 24 teams and holds five of the longest losing-season streaks trailing only Vanderbilt and Kansas. Those aren’t programs Big Ten teams should be happy about being grouped with, especially for a conference that prides itself on a long history of success.\nBefore the conference realignment, this would mean over half of the Big Ten had a losing record within the decade. Now, even with the conference expanding, it means that half of its teams appear on the list.\n\n\nCode\np4 &lt;- c(\"ACC\", \"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Big 12\")\n\nloserstable &lt;- records |&gt; \n  filter(Conf %in% p4) |&gt; \n  filter(Season != 2025) |&gt; \n  filter(Pct &lt; .5) |&gt; \n  group_by (School, Conf) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    avg_wins = round(mean(W), 1)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  top_n(15, wt=n)\n\n\nloserstable |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Conf = \"Conference\",\n    n = \"Losing Seasons\",\n    avg_wins= \"Average Wins\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Losing tradition?

Most of the teams who have spent years stuck in losing seasons are slowly showing signs of life. Several of the teams that once helped drag down the conference’s reputation are beginning to claw their way back toward the Big Ten’s winning ideals. In fact, throughout the 2025 season, Illinois and Michigan State stick out as the only two of the nine Big Ten teams on these lists who are not showing signs of upward momentum.\nComparatively, looking at the teams from the Big 12 and SEC, only Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi State, Texas Tech and Vanderbilt can claim they’re moving forward. The rest of the 15 remain on a downward slope or are evening out. So while the Big Ten’s lower tier may not be thriving quite yet, it does seem to be making steadier progress than its Power Four peers.\n\n\nCode\nloserrecordsovertime &lt;- records |&gt; \n  filter(School %in% loserstable$School)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept= 0.4910139, color=\"darkorange\") + \n  geom_line(data=loserrecordsovertime, aes(x=Season, y=Pct, group=School)) + \n  facet_wrap(~School) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Percent\", \n    title=\"Big Ten teams show signs of a 2025 rebound\", \n    subtitle=\"Seven of the nine Big Ten teams are trending upward during the 2025 season, while only five of the 15 Power \\nFour programs show similar progress.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Emma Baumgart\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
